## Purchase Orders

Purchase orders allow to track which parts are bought from suppliers and manufacturers, therefore converting externally bought items into stock items / inventory.

To access the purchase order page, click on the <span class="badge inventree nav main"><span class='fas fa-shopping-cart'></span> Buy</span> navigation tab and click on <span class="badge inventree nav main"><span class='fas fa-list'></span> Purchase Orders</span> option in the dropdown list.
