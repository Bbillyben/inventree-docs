## Manufacturers

A manufacturer is an external **producer** of parts and raw materials.

To access the manufacturer page, click on the "Buy" navigation tab and click on "Manufacturers" option in the dropdown list.

### Add Manufacturer

Once the manufacturer page is loaded, click on the "New Manufacturer" button: the "Create new Manufacturer" form opens. Fill-in the manufacturer informations (`Company name` and `Company description` are required) and click on "Submit".

!!! note "Manufacturer vs Supplier"
	In the case the manufacturer sells directly to customers, you may want to enable the checkbox `is supplier` before submitting the form (you can also enable it later on). Purchase orders rely exclusively on [supplier parts](../supplier#supplier-parts), therefore the manufacturer will need to be set as a supplier too.
