## Suppliers

A supplier is an external **vendor** of parts and raw materials.

To access the supplier page, click on the "Buy" navigation tab and click on "Suppliers" option in the dropdown list.

### Add Supplier

Once the supplier page is loaded, click on the "New Supplier" button: the "Create new Supplier" form opens. Fill-in the supplier informations (`Company name` and `Company description` are required) and click on "Submit".

!!! note "Supplier vs Manufacturer"
	In the case the supplier is a manufacturer who sells directly to customers, you may want to enable the checkbox `is manufacturer` before submitting the form (you can also enable it later on).
