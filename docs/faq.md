### Feature *x* is not visible after update

If a particular menu / item is not visible after updating InvenTree, it may be due to your internet browser caching old versions of CSS and JavaScript files.

Before [raising an issue](https://github.com/inventree/inventree/issues), try hard-refreshing the browser cache:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>

or

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>
