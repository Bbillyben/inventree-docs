## Releases

### Version Numbering

The InvenTree project follows the formalized release numbering scheme, according to the [semantic versioning specification](https://semver.org/). Each release will be numbered `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

#### MAJOR

Major release number will be incremented for large, incompatible changes to the API or other features.

#### MINOR

Minor release number will be incremented when new features are added in a backwards compatible manner

#### PATCH

Patch release number will be incremented when making bug fixes or small changes to existing features.
