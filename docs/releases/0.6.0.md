## Release 0.6.0

### Build Order Allocation

PR [#2094](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2094) represents a significant improvement to the worflow for allocating stock items against a build order. A new API endpoint has been created allowing stock items to be allocated against builds, with dynamic validation and feedback of error messages.

Additionally the workflow and UX has been simplified, allowing greater efficiency of stock allocation against a build order.

### Receiving Purchase Orders

PR [#2102](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2102) provides a major refactor of the process by which stock items are received against a purchase order. The receiving process now makes use of the REST API for a more responsive and intuitive user experience.
