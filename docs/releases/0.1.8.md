## Release 0.1.8

[Release 0.1.8](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.1.8) (WIP) provides a number of major new features and improvements, as well as some crucial bug fixes:

## New Featues

### Order Responsibility

[#1395](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1395) adds the concept of *responsibility* for Purchase Orders and Sales Orders. Orders can be assigned to either an individual user, or an entire group.

### Order Reports

[#1397](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/1397) adds the ability to generate PDF Reports against Purchase Orders and Sales Orders. This new feature provides a framework for generating reports such as invoices, sales orders, packing lists, etc. While it provides the framework for such reports, generic templates for these report types have not yet been created.
