## Building Parts

Build management can be accessed via the *Build* navigation tab.

A "basic" build flow is as follow:

1. create a part with the [*Assembly option*](/part/views/#part-options) turned-on
0. add a Bill of Material (BOM)
0. create a "Build Order" for this part
0. allocate stocks from your inventory
0. update build status and notes
0. complete the build.

### Part BOM

Read through the [Bill of Materials documentation](/build/bom) to setup a part BOM before creating a "Build Order".
