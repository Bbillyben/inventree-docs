## PanelMixin

The `PanelMixin` enables plugins to render custom content to "panels" on individual pages in the web interface.

Most pages in the web interface support multiple panels, which are selected via the sidebar menu on the left side of the screen:

{% with id="panels", url="plugin/panels.png", description="Display panels" %}
{% include 'img.html' %}
{% endwith %}
