## Translation Support

The InvenTree app, much like the InvenTree web-based application, is designed to support multiple language translations.

As with the web application, translations are community contributed - if the app does not support your native language, contributions are very welcome!

## Contributing

Translation files for the InvenTree app are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/inventree/inventree-app-i18n/).

A Python helper script simplifies the translation process by presenting the user with words or phrases which require translation, one item at a time.

Full translation efforts, while appreciated, are not required. Please feel free to contribute as much as you can!
